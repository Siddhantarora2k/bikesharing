# bikesharing

### Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to create a proposal that supports investors to support a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. From the given dataset, we were able to create visualizations to see average biking durations trends and the relationships between gender and popular biking times. Specifically, this set of visualizations:

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

### Summary 
Based on the analysis we can say that most of the Bikeriders were male, which can be a great marketing subject. However if we see in the dataset most of the customers are the __subscribers__ which means they are daily commuters so it looks like most of them travel to and from work because most of the bike rides is in the morning around 5 and around 6-7 in the eveing.
